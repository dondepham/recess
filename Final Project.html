   <h2>Final Project</h2>
    
    
    <h3>Due date</h3>
Final project will be due on December 10th at 5pm.

<h3>How to submit</h3>
  It should be in a subfolder in your public_html folder in a folder called final_project.  In addition
to this, your project will also be submitted to CCLE.  Create a zip of all your files + a text file that contains a working link to your final project in
the public folder.  It is imperative that we have a link to your project so we can find it and grade it!!

<h3>Final vs. Final project</h3>
You may choose one of: a) Complete the final project or b) Take the final on the designated day.  You may not choose both.


<h3>General requirements</h3>
Your project will be "web app" that demonstrates use of all major topics we learned during the quarter.  Your grade may also improve if you demonstrate good use of minor
topics.

<h4>list the of the topics/concepts that all final projects must demonstrate</h4>

All projects must demonstrate correct XHTML markup that validates, or HTML5.

<ul>
<li>Your page must use external CSS stylesheet and look pleasing.</li>

<li>Your project must incorporate cookies.</li>

<li>Your project must use JS.</li>

<li>Your project must use events.</li>

<li>Your project must use DOM methods in a significant way.</li>
</ul>


You must write a short (1 page max) instructions on how to use your online app, and what grade you are hoping to get for your project, and how you have satisified the requirements for that grade.


<h3>Requirements for an A grade</h3>
<ul>
<li>All the basic requirements satisfied</li>
<li>Must include an interaction with SQLite3 database using Ajax.</li>
<li>Your code must write something to the database using Ajax and then retrieve something from the database using Ajax. Timestamps should be used.</li>
<li>Page content should be refreshed via Ajax.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Requirements for B grade</h3>
<ul>
<li>All the basic requirements satisfied</li>
<li>For B grade your code does not need to use Ajax.  Instead it can work much like our homework assignment #6.  There could be a form to enter data.</li>
<li>This data is then written into a database and then your webpage will read info from the database and create a dynamic response page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>requirements for C grade</h3>
<ul>
<li>All the basic requirements satisfied</li>
<li>For C grade you need not use a database</li>
</ul>

<h3>What determines your grade?</h3>
Starting point for your grade is the grade whose requirements you satisfy.  However, your grade may be slightly higher or lower, depending on some factors.
<h4>You will lose points</h4>
<ul>
<li>If there are errors or your work is sloppy or somehow just bare minimum, you may get
an A-, B- etc.  If the project just does not work.  For example if you try to go for the A, but cannot get your Ajax to work, then you may end up
with a C.</li>
</ul>

<h4>You may gain points</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your project is particularly impressive or creative</li>
<li>You incorporate some of the minor topics we discussed during the course</li>
</ul>

<h4>Minor topics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your project will benefit if it uses some animation.</li>
<li>Your project will benefit if it uses XML in some way.</li>
<li>Additional benefit if your XML can be verified by a DTD.</li>
<li>Additional benefit if your project uses the session stuff.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some examples</h2><h2>

</h2><h3>Forum</h3>
<p>
Build a simple forum that people can post notes on.  Ajax version of this page is that people can simply click on a post button and a form is dynamically created that the user can fill
then the post is stored in a database.  Your Ajax should fetch new posts from the database every couple of seconds and append them to the forum.  The forum
should also always display how many seconds, minutes hours, days ago each post was posted.  This info should be updated with Ajax every minute.
</p>
<h3>Interactive map</h3>
<p>
A map of some region that you can create pins in by clicking on locations.  When a user clicks on a location a form pops up that user can write some info about
that pin location.  Subsequently when a user howevers over the pin location info about the location should pop up in a little info div above the pin.
</p>
<h3>Strawpoll</h3>
<p>
Create a version of <a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/" target="_blank">http://www.strawpoll.me/</a>
</p>

<p>
Be creative.  I would rather see something different from these 3 examples.  Creativity may boost a grade.
